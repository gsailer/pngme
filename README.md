# pngme.

Have you ever wanted to know if a fellow human in your flat is available during lockdown, but ran into the problem, that you interrupted them during an important meeting or destroyed their flow.
Pngme solves this problem by allowing non-invasive checks, which can be answered by a simple head movement like a nod.
Even if your regular knock on the door would not be heard, the knock in pngme is played on the headphones of the reciver. Because of that you can be sure to receive a response.

In order to simplify usage on the local network there is the option to Check people's availabilty either through the app or if you do not want to install the app through the web app.
The app is required for the gesture interaction with the ESense Earable headphones.

This project is a prototype developed in the context of a lecture at the KIT.
